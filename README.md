# AHK Scripts

**altresize.ahk**
  - allows you to resize and drag windows like in Linux, using alt+left click for drag and alt+right click for resize.
  
**hotkeys.ahk**
  - adds some hotkeys to Windows:
    - win+ctrl+shift+w/a/s/d to open the windows resizing dialog for resizing in a specific direction
    - win+v to minimize currently focused window
    - win+c to close currently focused window
    - win+shift+z to open Sound options
    - win+z to open Volume Mixer
    - win+f to restart explorer.exe (easy fix for systray icons becoming blurry due to turning monitors off/on or putting Windows to sleep/hibernate)
    - win+a to change audio playback device, cycles through "Speakers" or "Headphones" and relies on nircmd (google it, amazing software)
    - win+ctrl+shift+1 to open firefox.exe
    - win+ctrl+shift+2 to open cygwin terminal
    - win+ctrl+shift+3 to send currently focused window to other screen
    - Spotify controls:
      - ctrl+shift+mouse back for previous song

Some of these were written by people in the AHK community, others were written by me. Credit goes to the individuals responsible. Hard to find the source for some of these scripts as they are 10+ years old and the forum posts are long gone.
